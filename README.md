# Biff workshop repo

See https://findka.com/biff/, https://youtu.be/tDp1l81fYSM.

The most interesting part is [76a76d5](https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff-workshop/commit/76a76d5f774c29785e4d22e1741ec4fb491ae819), which demonstrates adding a new feature to a Biff application. The rest of the code is just from running the [Getting Started](https://findka.com/biff/#getting-started) command.
